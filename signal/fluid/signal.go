/*
Fluid is the mechanical perspective on the order book, mapping
microstructural metrics — Reynolds Number (Re), Divergence (Div),
Vorticity (Vort), and Turbulence (Turb) — against Viscosity (Visc).

1. What it measures exactly (in isolation)

The Fluid signal applies order-book fluid dynamics per symbol from book,
trades, and ticks. Reynolds classifies laminar versus turbulent flow.
Divergence is ∇·(ρv) at the touch. Viscosity is replenishment resistance
after consumption.

It isolates the following mechanical states:

Laminar Stability (Orderly Flow): High Viscosity (tight bid/ask spreads)
coupled with low Field Activity.

Turbulent Chaos (Mechanical Breakdown): Dominant Turbulence readings
(Turb) and high Vorticity (Vort).

Inertial Displacement (Directional Surge): A high Reynolds Number (Re)
and high Divergence (Div).

Viscous Resistance (The "Grind"): Low Viscosity (wide spreads/high
resistance) with moderate Divergence. Price memory (fractional-diff proxy
from recent last-price span) reinforces viscous scoring when replenishment
lags displacement.

---

2. Semantically, what story does it tell?

The Fluid signal tells the story of mechanical health — whether the
"vapour pipe" of the market is running smoothly or shattering.

The "Smooth Pipe" Story: Price moves are smooth and the book absorbs
updates without churning. The market is at a constant, manageable diameter.

The "Shattered Mechanics" Story: High turbulence and vorticity readings
signal genuine microstructural chaos rather than price volatility alone.

The "Grind" Story: Every tick move requires a massive amount of "work"
(traded volume), but spread resistance keeps displacement contained.

1. Laminar Stability (Orderly Flow)

The "vapour pipe" of the market is at a constant, manageable diameter.
Indicators: High Viscosity (tight spreads) coupled with low Field Activity.
Semantic Meaning: Price moves are smooth, and the book is absorbing updates
without churning.

2. Turbulent Chaos (Mechanical Breakdown)

The internal mechanics of the market are "shattering," often preceding a
major regime shift.
Indicators: Dominant Turbulence readings and high Vorticity.
Semantic Meaning: Genuine microstructural chaos rather than just price
volatility.

3. Inertial Displacement (Directional Surge)

The market is being forcibly "pushed" by one-sided order flow.
Indicators: A high Reynolds Number and high Divergence.
Semantic Meaning: The ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces has
exploded. High information density in the current event window.

4. Viscous Resistance (The "Grind")

Price is "grinding against a wall."
Indicators: Low Viscosity (wide spreads/high resistance) with moderate
Divergence.
Semantic Meaning: The market is "thick" or viscous. Every tick move
requires massive traded volume.

# Summary of Fluid Categories

| Category   | Visc (Spread) | Dominant Metric            | Market "Feel"      |
|:-----------|:--------------|:---------------------------|:-------------------|
| Laminar    | High (Tight)  | None (Low Activity)        | Smooth/Consistent  |
| Turbulent  | Variable      | Turbulence / Vorticity     | Shattered/Fragile  |
| Inertial   | Moderate      | Reynolds / Divergence      | Direct/Heavy       |
| Viscous    | Low (Wide)    | Divergence (at walls)      | Resistant/Grinding |

Viscosity is the inverse of the spread; activity, displacement and turbulence
are derived inline against the pair's own median-scaled baselines.
